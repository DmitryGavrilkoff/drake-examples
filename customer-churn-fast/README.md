This example is similar to [`customer-churn-simple`](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/tree/master/customer-churn-simple), but it adds complexity and bookkeeping to avoid a [potential serialization bottleneck](https://github.com/richfitz/storr/issues/77#issuecomment-476275570) when it comes to storing Keras models. Here, we use [`file_in()`](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/reference/file_in.html) and [`file_out()`](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/reference/file_out.html) to track special model files [stored in HDF5 format](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_restore_models#as_an_hdf5_file). Scripts `functions.R` and `plan.R` are a bit more complicated.
