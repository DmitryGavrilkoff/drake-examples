This example is based on [RStudio Solutions Engineering example of how to use Keras and TensorFlow with R](https://github.com/sol-eng/tensorflow-w-r). The motivation comes from a [blog post by Matt Dancho](https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2018-01-11-keras-customer-churn), and the code is based on a [notebook by Edgar Ruiz](https://github.com/sol-eng/tensorflow-w-r/blob/master/workflow/tensorflow-drake.Rmd). In this particular workflow, we train and compare multiple deep neural nets with different batch sizes.

If it takes too long to store your deep learning models this kind of workflow, try [`customer-churn-fast`](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/tree/master/customer-churn-fast).
