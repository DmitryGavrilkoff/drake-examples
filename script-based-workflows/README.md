This is the example on how to use the `code_to_function()` tool that is implemented in `drake` >= 7.6.2.9000. This function allows for script-based workflows.
Original example was written by [Kirill MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/krlmlr), and adapted by [Ellis Hughes](https://github.com/thebioengineer) to demonstrate script based workflows.
