Run `make.R` to generate the output `report.pdf` and its dependencies. Because we use `code_to_function()` to render this, `drake` will know `report.pdf` depends on targets `fit`, and `hist`.

```{r content}
library(drake)

fit<- readRDS(here("data","fit.RDS"))
print(fit)

readRDS(here("data","Petal_Width_vs_Species.RDS"))
```
