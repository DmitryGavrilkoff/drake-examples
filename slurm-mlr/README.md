# Disclaimer

This example shows how to use `drake` to perform a benchmark analysis using two algorithms (KNN, SVM) across two datasets.

The shown tuning ranges and settings of the cross-validation are not meant to make sense. 
They are chosen so that the example finishes within 5 minutes with the specified resources.
Runtime will differ depending on how your CPUs are.
