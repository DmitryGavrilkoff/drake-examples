This example borrows from an [RStudio Solutions Engineering example of how to use TensorFlow with R](https://github.com/sol-eng/tensorflow-w-r). The motivation comes from a [blog post by Matt Dancho](https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2018-01-11-keras-customer-churn), and the code is modified from a [notebook by Edgar Ruiz](https://github.com/sol-eng/tensorflow-w-r/blob/master/workflow/tensorflow-drake.Rmd).
